A coffee bean is the seed of the coffee plant and the source for coffee. It is mostly grown in plantations similar to tea and chocolate.</p>

The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available. Single-origins are viewed by some as a way to get a specific taste, and some independent coffee shops have found that this gives them a way to add value over large chains.</p>

                                        <p>Arabica Coffee, also known as the Arabian coffee, "coffee shrub of Arabia", or "mountain coffee" is a species of Coffea. Native to Ethiopia, it is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, and represents approximately 60% of global production. Coffee made from Arabica beans is more acidic, less bitter, and contain less caffeine than Robusta beans. It is primarily used in espresso and french press based coffee.</p>

Robusta coffee originated in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is easy to care for, has a greater crop yield, has almost double the amount of caffeine and more antioxidants, and is less susceptible to disease than Arabica coffee. It represents approximately 40% of global coffee production.</p>

                                    <p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans into roasted coffee products. The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.</p>

Oils can be seen on the beans at this point. Historically, dark roasts have been popular in Europe, giving rise to terms such as Continental, Italian, French, and Spanish roasts. Espresso roasts are also usually dark roasts, which is partly why espresso can stand up to lots of milk and sugar.</p>

At this roast level, the coffee's qualities begin to give way to the roasts flavors and aromas, creating a balance between acidity and body. You'll still be able to taste the original coffee, but the beans brightness will be complemented with the fuller body that is introduced by the roasting process.</p>

                                    <p>One of the most important steps in making coffee is the grinding process. Coffee beans are delicate and deserve to be treated with care if you want them to relinquish their oils and rich flavors. To get the most out of your beans, you should invest in a burr grinder, manual or electric. Though there is some overlap, most brew methods call for different grind sizes. A burr grinder will give you control over how fine or coarse your grounds are.</p>

                                        <p>Espresso is coffee of Italian origin, brewed by expressing or forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods and as a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. Espresso is also the base for other drinks such as a latte, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha, flat white, or long black.</p>

Let hot water steep over coarsely ground coffee for 3-4 minutes before pressing down the filter and serving. It doesn’t get more simple than that.
